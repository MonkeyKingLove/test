hello,Mr qiang
hello boy!


第一次听这歌真的是因为那部电视剧。
我记得猪八戒是黄海波演的，
范冰冰演的锦毛鼠。
当时实在是因为年纪小看不懂他们在干什么，
只知道锦毛鼠死了，
猪八戒抱着哭啊哭，
后来听到的飘摇都是周迅唱的。
好多年过去，
还能找到这个版本，
时间是个好娃娃，
该遇到的会遇到的能遇到的都会遇到。
Long did I sigh and wipe away my tears,To see my people bowed by griefs and fears.
Though I my gifts enhanced and curbed my pride,At morn they'd mock me, would at eve deride;
First cursed that I angelica should wear,Then cursed me for my melilotus fair.
But since my heart did love such purity,I'd not regret a thousand deaths to die.
I marvel at the folly of the king,So heedless of his people's suffering.
They envied me my mothlike eyebrows fine,And so my name his damsels did malign.
Truly to craft alone their praise they paid,The square in measuring they disobeyed;
With confidence their crooked lines they traced.
In sadness plunged and sunk in deepest gloom,Alone I drove on to my dreary doom.
In exile rather would I meet my end,Than to the baseness of their ways descend.
Remote the eagle spurns the common range,Nor deigns since time began its way to change;
A circle fits not with a square design;Their different ways could not be merged with mine.
Yet still my heart I checked and curbed my pride,Their blame endured and their reproach beside.
To die for righteousness alone I sought,For this was what the ancient sages taught.

人生总有些事情要经历，也总有些事情要面对，不要总是逃避，也不要总是抱怨！
